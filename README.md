# Cinematic Project

Cinematic is a **movie** lookup project that provides comprehensive information about movies,
including their casts, ratings, trailers, related movies, and genres.

It features a search function that allows users to easily find specific movies or actors,
as well as the ability to sort movies by popularity, release date, and rating.

In addition, users can view actor profiles and see a list of movies that they have participated in.
This project is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks are used.

I collaborated with my bootcamp classmates to build this project. We used git to manage our code, GitHub to host the project, and Cloudfare pages to deploy it.

This project uses The Movie DB API: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` as a backend for the API.

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
